# Introduction
This will be used to code the logic for Aakash.
The project is that I have to use web-scrapping to donwload files automatically from the internet.
The link for the website is https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/vahan4dashboard/vahan/vahan/view/reportview.xhtml
When the file will be downloaded, it should also save the file with the name required.
We need to download the file for 10 years and for 7 pincodes, so in total it makes 70 files.
The conda env on local repo is web-scrapping38
